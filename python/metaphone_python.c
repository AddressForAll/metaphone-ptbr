/*
 * This is a port of the Double Metaphone based algorithm for brazilian 
 * portuguese, developed by Prefeitura Municipal de Varzea Paulista for PHP.
 *
 *
 * OBJECTIVES:
 *
 * As Double Metaphone, the ideia is to compute sound like strings, but
 * in this case, just for brazilian portuguese. Why? Because would be nice
 * to have generic tool for every language, but sometimes is not desirable or
 * either maintanable. Any changes could break the original metaphone code, and 
 * one way of avoiding this is introducing more "alternate" strings. Another one
 * is creating specifics metaphone functions for each language. That's my choice
 *
 * Information on using Double Metaphone can be found at
 *       http://www.codeproject.com/string/dmetaphone1.asp
 * and the original article describing it can be found at
 *       http://www.cuj.com/documents/s=8038/cuj0006philips/
 *
 * The original port for portuguese can be found here:
